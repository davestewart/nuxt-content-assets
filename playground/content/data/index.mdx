# Data files

> Data files should not be made public

This index file should render but none of the files in this folder should be copied to the `public` folder during build, so the following links should 404:

- [index.mdx](/data/index.mdx)
- [CSV.csv](/data/CSV.csv)
- [JSON.json](/data/JSON.json)
- [YAML.yml](/data/YAML.yml)

You can still query them in code though, for example:

```js
await queryContent('/data/YAML').findOne()
```
