Finely chop the parsley. Zest then quarter the lemon. Peel the courgette into ribbons and place into a bowl. Add half the zest, juice from 2 lemon wedges, half the parsley, a pinch of sea salt, black pepper and 1 tsp oil to the bowl. Gently mix to combine.

Finally, stir the remaining parsley and juice from the remaining lemon through the stew. Finish with chilli flakes (to taste) and the remaining zest. Serve the courgette salad on the side.
