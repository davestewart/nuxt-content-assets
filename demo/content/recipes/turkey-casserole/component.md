## Info

- Cook time: 15 mins
- Cuisine: Italian
- Food group: Poultry
- Key ingredient: Free-range British turkey
- Allergens: Celery

## Ingredients

- 300g free-range diced turkey breast
- 250g steamed brown basmati rice
- 110g baby plum tomatoes
- 40g baby spinach
- 80g coconut yoghurt
- 1 leek
- 2 tbsp red pesto
- 1 vegetable stock cube (Celery)
- 2 garlic clove
- 1 tsp oregano (dried)

## Instructions

Boil a half-full kettle. Dissolve the stock cube in a jug with 50ml boiling water (25ml for 1 person).

Heat a large frying pan with 1 tbsp oil on medium heat. Add the turkey and cook for 6-7 mins, until golden. Meanwhile, finely chop or crush the garlic. Trim and thinly slice the leek into half-moons. Halve the tomatoes.

Add the garlic and leek to the pan and cook for 5 mins, until softening. Add the tomatoes, stock, yoghurt, dried oregano and pesto. Season with black pepper and simmer for 3-4 mins, until the sauce thickens and the turkey is cooked through. Add a splash of water to prevent burning, if necessary.

Heat another frying pan on medium heat. Add the spinach, rice and a splash of water. Break up the rice with a wooden spoon and cook for 2-3 mins, until the spinach has wilted and the rice is piping hot. Season with sea salt and black pepper.

Check your turkey is cooked through by cutting into a large piece; the flesh should be white and the juices running clear. Cook for longer if necessary.

Serve the creamy sundried tomato turkey with the spinach rice.
